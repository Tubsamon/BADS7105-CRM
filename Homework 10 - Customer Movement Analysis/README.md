# Homework 10 - Customer Movement Analysis

In this session, 


### 1. Goal : 
  - To analyze movement of customer.

### 2. Procedure :
  - You can use data from [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qjwJYTPHZcy193x1ND4TVFvAoPAmh1X1?usp=sharing).
  - Query data by Google Big Query 
    - SQL code for query has shown as below. 
    


  - Add new CLV parameter.
  - Delete some parameter by considering from Correlation Matrix Plots and Pair Plots.
  - After run model again >> get the better result.
  - You can follow step-by-step from [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hPG0twUNGK63S_2I2ChHb2KzmOjf65BL?usp=sharing)
  - In the link has steps as below
      - Importing libraries and datasets
      - Data Preparation
      - Calculating response rate
      - Creating train and test dataset
      - Fixing imbalanced with Undersampling
      - Fixing imbalanced with Oversampling
      - Fixing imbalanced with SMOTE
      - Training models for 2 methods : Logistic Regression and XGBoost 
### 3. Conclusion : By using logistic regression model - undersampled
  - Precision = 0.22, Recall = 0.75, f1-Score = 0.34, Accuracy = 0.69, AUC = 0.78
